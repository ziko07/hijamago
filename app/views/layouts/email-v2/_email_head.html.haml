  = stylesheet_link_tag "email-v2"
  -#
    For some reason, emails use @community even though the convention is to use @current_community
    So, try to use @current_community but fallback to @community
    ALSO, there might be some mailer methods which define NEITHER @current_community nor @community, so
    in these cases, fallback to "347f9d"

    TODO: Go through mailer methods and define @current_community in all of them

  - community = @current_community || @community
  - color = Maybe(community).custom_color1.or_else { "347f9d" }

  :scss
    $link1: ##{color};

    a {
      color: $link1 !important;
    }

    .email-action-button {
      background: $link1 !important;
    }
