      title: PayPal's payment processing fee
      body_text: |-
        For PayPal payments, %{service_name} charges a commission of %{paypal_commission}%. PayPal's fees are not included in this commission, so in addition to %{service_name} commission, you also need to pay PayPal's fees from each payment processed by PayPal. PayPal's fee is between 2% and 5% of the total sales price, depending on your monthly sales volume and the country of residence of the buyer. In general, domestic purchases have lower fees than international ones, and higher monthly sales give you a discount on fees.
        You can see the exact fees by logging in to your PayPal account and going %{link_to_paypal}. After each purchase you will get a receipt displaying the exact fee.
